Mal-Email Detector 🛡️

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN/MLP) based email classifier that detects malicious emails (spam and phishing) using NLP text preprocessing and TF-IDF feature extraction.

📌 Overview

This project builds a binary classifier to distinguish between safe (ham) and malicious (spam/phishing) emails. It uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (ANN) trained on TF-IDF vectorized email text, combining multiple well-known public email datasets for broader coverage of attack types.

📊 Dataset

Source: Phishing Email Dataset (Kaggle) — "Phish No More"

This is a combined dataset merging six public email corpora:

Enron Spam Dataset
Ling-Spam Dataset
CEAS 2008 Spam Corpus
Nazario Phishing Corpus
Nigerian Fraud Emails
SpamAssassin Public Corpus

File used: phishing_email.csv Columns: text_combined (email text), label (0 = safe/ham, 1 = malicious/phishing) Size after cleaning: ~80,726 emails (label 0: 38,010 | label 1: 42,716)

⚙️ Pipeline
Data Loading — Load combined CSV, verify label balance
Text Cleaning — Lowercase, remove URLs, remove digits, remove punctuation, normalize whitespace
Duplicate Removal — Drop duplicates on (clean_text, label) pair (not on text alone, to avoid accidentally collapsing an entire class)
Feature Extraction — TF-IDF vectorization (top 3,000 features)
Train/Test Split — 80/20 split, stratified on label
Model — ANN (Multi-Layer Perceptron) built with Keras
Training — With EarlyStopping to prevent overfitting
Evaluation — Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall/F1
Inference — Tested on custom real-world example emails

Metric	Score
Test Accuracy	98.45%
Precision (Safe)	0.99
Recall (Safe)	0.98
Precision (Malicious)	0.98
Recall (Malicious)	0.99

Model was validated on custom, unseen example emails (lottery scams, phishing links, and genuine business emails) and correctly classified the clear-cut cases, with reasonable uncertainty on genuinely ambiguous borderline emails.

🚀 How to Use the Saved Model
python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import joblib
import re, string

# Load model and vectorizer
model = load_model("mal_email_detector.keras")
tfidf = joblib.load("tfidf_vectorizer.joblib")

def clean_text(text):
    text = str(text).lower()
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)
    text = re.sub(r'\d+', '', text)
    text = text.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))
    text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text).strip()
    return text

# Predict on a new email
email = ["Your account has been suspended, click here to verify immediately"]
clean = [clean_text(e) for e in email]
vec = tfidf.transform(clean).toarray()
prediction = model.predict(vec)

print("Malicious/Spam" if prediction[0][0] > 0.5 else "Safe/Ham")

⚠️ Known Limitations
Trained on English-language email text only
TF-IDF loses word order and semantic context — struggles with genuinely ambiguous, short, generic business-style emails (e.g. invoice/payment requests) that share vocabulary with both legitimate and phishing emails
Does not use metadata features (sender domain, headers, links, SPF records) — text content only
Dataset skews toward older-style spam (Enron era); may not generalize to newer, more sophisticated phishing techniques without periodic retraining
🔮 Possible Future Improvements
Add metadata/header-based features (sender domain reputation, number of links, urgency-keyword scoring)
Try transformer-based models (DistilBERT) for better contextual understanding
Expand to 3-class classification (Safe / Spam / Phishing) instead of binary
Build a simple web demo (Flask/Streamlit) for live testing
